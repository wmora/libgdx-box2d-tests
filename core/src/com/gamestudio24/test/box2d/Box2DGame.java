            the reactions between them. It does not however render the objects for you;
            for that you will use libgdx graphics functions.
            The first argument we supply is a 2D vector containing the gravity: 0 to indicate
            no gravity in the horizontal direction, and -10 is a downwards force like in real life
            (assuming your y axis points upwards). These values can be anything you like, but
            remember to stick to a constant scale. In Box2D 1 unit = 1 metre.

            A fixture has a shape, density, friction and restitution attached to it.
            Shape is obvious.
            Density is the mass per square metre: a bowling ball is very dense, yet a balloon isnâ€™t
                very dense at all as it is mainly filled with air.
            Friction is the amount of opposing force when the object rubs/slides along something: a
                block of ice would have a very low friction but a rubber ball would have a high
                friction.
            Restitution is how bouncy something is: a rock would have a very low restitution but
                a basketball would have a fairly high restitution. A body with a restitution of 0
                will come to a halt as soon as it hits the ground, whereas a body with a
                restitution of 1 would bounce to the same height forever.
